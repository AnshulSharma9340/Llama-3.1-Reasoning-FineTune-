# 🚀 ReasonMind-3B  
### Distilling Deep Reasoning into a 3B Parameter LLM using Unsloth, QLoRA & Llama-3.1

ReasonMind-3B is an advanced **reasoning-distilled** language model built on **Llama-3.1 (3B)**, fine-tuned using **Unsloth** and **4-bit QLoRA**.  
The model learns to perform **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** reasoning inspired by DeepSeek-R1 — enabling structured, step-by-step logical thinking even on small hardware.

This project demonstrates how reasoning capabilities can be **compressed, distilled, and efficiently deployed** in a compact model format that runs fully offline.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Standard small LLMs struggle with complex reasoning. ReasonMind-3B solves this by:

- Using DeepSeek-R1 reasoning traces through the **R1-Distill-SFT** dataset  
- Fine-tuning with **Unsloth** to reduce VRAM usage by ~60%  
- Leveraging **4-bit QLoRA**, training only ~0.5% parameters  
- Adding a built-in `<think>` reasoning phase for structured problem solving  
- Deploying in **GGUF (Q8_0)** format for offline inference  

The model achieves improved performance on multi-step math, word puzzles, logic problems, and analytical tasks — all on a single GPU or CPU.

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**  
  Generates a hidden `<think>` block replicating step-by-step thought process.

- **Unsloth-Optimized Training**  
  2× faster training and ~60% VRAM reduction.

- **4-bit QLoRA Fine-Tuning**  
  Lightweight training — updating only a tiny slice of parameters.

- **Distilled from DeepSeek-R1 Logic**  
  High-quality reasoning examples → stronger logic abilities.

- **Offline Deployment via GGUF**  
  Runs on **Ollama**, **LM Studio**, **llama.cpp**, and **llama-cpp-python**.

## 🔥 Inference Example (Python)

```python
from llama_cpp import Llama

llm = Llama(
    model_path="model/gguf/reasonmind-3b-q8_0.gguf"
)

response = llm("Solve: If A has 3 apples and buys 5 more, how many total?")
print(response["choices"][0]["text"])
```
🧪 Sample Output
<think>
A has 3 apples. He buys 5 more.
3 + 5 = 8 apples.
</think>

Final Answer: 8 apples.
